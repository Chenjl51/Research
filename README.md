# Back-Support Exoskeleton Project  

## Project Overview  
This repository is used to record my work related to **exoskeleton control and algorithms**.  
In our group, the **lower-limb exoskeleton** has already been developed to a relatively complete stage, both in hardware and control.  

My current task is to:  
- Study the algorithms and control methods behind the lower-limb exoskeleton.  
- Refer to and learn from related research at **Harvard University**.  
- Apply and adapt these methods to a **back-support exoskeleton**, focusing on assisting back movement.

## Objectives  
- Understand the control strategies used in the lower-limb exoskeleton.  
- Explore how these strategies can be applied to a back-support exoskeleton.  
- Test and adjust the algorithms for practical use.  

---

## Plan  
- **Phase 1**: Go through the existing work on the lower-limb system.  
- **Phase 2**: Summarize useful algorithms from Harvard’s related studies.  
- **Phase 3**: Implement and evaluate them on a back-support exoskeleton.
