# Paper Note


## Background
- Task : Specific Tasks and Diverse Tasks

- Rigid and soft :
  Rigid -> exoskeleton
  Soft  -> exosuit

- Passive and Activate system
 Passive system suits for specific tasks, but is short in diverse tasks.
  walking, reaching down, lifting task
 Activate Task

- Complex movement in a dynamic workplace

- Only one research showed passive back exoskeleton can reduce pressure, and it was quickly proved that it was uncomfortable in another research.

- Havard's lab recently produced an exoskeleton which performed perfectly in both assisstance and confort. But it only suited for short-term activity, and must be applied to long-period activities.

## Results
![Exoskeleton example](https://github.com/Chenjl51/Research/blob/main/images/example.png)
- Three IMUs

- The apparel didn't restrict the range of lateral motion

### Adaptive impedance controller

- (a)
- Relative Angle
- Give a formula of relative angle, used for later analysis
- (b)
-  Required force for two phace
- (c)
- The relation between force and angular velocity(w)
- In order to mitigate the feeling of mistriggering
- (d)
- Input: Angle + angular velocity (calculated by the IMU).
- Output: A continuous and smooth assistive force value.
- During lifting → strong assistance.
- During lowering → light assistance.
- During transition → smooth interpolation to ensure a natural user experience.
