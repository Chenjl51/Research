# Paper Note


## Background
- Task : Specific Tasks and Diverse Tasks

- Rigid and soft :
  Rigid -> exoskeleton
  Soft  -> exosuit

- Passive and Activate system
 Passive system suits for specific tasks, but is short in diverse tasks.
  walking, reaching down, lifting task
 Activate Task

- Complex movement in a dynamic workplace

- Only one research showed passive back exoskeleton can reduce pressure, and it was quickly proved that it was uncomfortable in another research.

- Havard's lab recently produced an exoskeleton which performed perfectly in both assisstance and confort. But it only suited for short-term activity, and must be applied to long-period activities.

## Results

- Three IMUs

- The apparel didn't restrict the range of lateral motion
